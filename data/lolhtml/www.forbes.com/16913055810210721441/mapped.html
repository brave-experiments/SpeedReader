<p><sup class="drop-cap color-accent font-accent">I</sup><strong>n the world of professional video games,</strong> winning isn’t everything.&nbsp; <em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>phenom Tyler “Ninja” Blevins made $17 million last year, enough for first place on&nbsp;<em>Forbes’</em>&nbsp;inaugural ranking of top-earning gamers, but the 28-year-old pro won less than $100,000 competing. In fact, Ninja didn’t even qualify for the first-ever&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>World Cup, which was held in New York’s Arthur Ashe stadium last July, or its $3 million grand prize. (That money was won by Kyle “Bugha” Giersdorf, a 16-year old from Pennsylvania).</p>
<p>That’s because top-earning gamers are more influencer than they are elite athlete. They earn their millions from leveraging their massive online followings into endorsements, fees and sponsorships. Ninja has 2.8 million followers on Mixer, Microsoft’s nascent gaming platform, which <em>Forbes</em>&nbsp;estimates will spend $30 million over three years after luring him from arch-rival Twitch last August. The blue-haired gamer has an additional 22.7 million YouTube subscribers and 14.9 million followers on Instagram. In all, the ten top-earning gamers have a combined 270 million followers across YouTube, Twitch and Mixer and earned $121 million last year. None of them made the list through competition alone.</p>

<p>The next step? Mainstream celebrity. Ninja, who has been a pro gamer in one form or another since starting with&nbsp;<em>Halo 3</em>&nbsp;in 2009, is well under way. His visage adorned soft drink cans thanks to an endorsement deal with Red Bull. Adidas has a Ninja sneaker. In the last year he has appeared on&nbsp;<em>The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Daily Show with Trevor Noah</em>, and performed as a guest vocalist on Fox’s&nbsp;<em>The Masked Singer</em>. Ninja merchandise—from a graphic novel to his signature headband—can be purchased at Walmart and Target.</p>
<p>And Ninja is just one of hundreds of internet entertainers cashing in on the growing influence of streaming and gaming culture, which has brands including Monster Energy, Postmates and State Farm paying up in their hunger to reach the elusive Millennial audience; eMarketer estimates sponsorships and advertising spends in gaming alone would hit $3.3 billion in 2019.</p>
<p>The biggest streamers buttress that revenue by collecting directly from their followers, who can “tip” them with direct one-time payments or pay for a premium subscription that the players split with platforms like Amazon’s Twitch and Mixer. At his peak, Blevins made upwards of $500,000 per month, splitting the $4.99 premium fee fans paid to Twitch.</p>

<p>Three months after Ninja signed with Mixer, Michael “Shroud” Grzesiek, a former&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&nbsp;</em>pro who retired in 2018 at 23 (No. 5, $12.5 million), followed. Both gamers were cashing in on Microsoft’s desperation to give relevance to Mixer, which lags Facebook, YouTube and Twitch in total gaming hours watched, according to both Palo Alto-based streaming toolmaker StreamElements and Chicago-based data analyst Arsenal.gg.</p>
<p>Pro gaming is still the Wild West. There is no government agency overseeing decency on streaming sites and the personalities making the most noise aren’t always peddling the most high-minded material.</p>
<p>Felix “PewDiePie” Kjellberg (No. 2, with $15 million) has lost partnerships because of anti-Semitic and racist videos. His audience has stuck with the Swedish gamer, though; he remains the most subscribed-to individual on YouTube. Blevins himself was caught in a controversy after he said in August 2018 he wouldn’t stream with women because of possible relationship rumors that could emerge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Controversies aside, it’s a ripe time to cash in. Mixer’s announcement of the Ninja deal had the feel of a major league free agency press event and triggered an expensive chase for talent. It was a smart move to jump. Blevins had around 250,000 premium subscribers in March 2018 and a year later was down to about 20,000, according to TwitchTracker. Since then, platforms including Facebook, YouTube and Caffeine have been signing more gamers to exclusive deals, including Jeremy “Disguised Toast” Wang, Jack “CouRage” Dunlop and Rachell “Valkyrae” Hofstetter.</p>
<p><em>Forbes&nbsp;</em>estimates Mixer will pay Grzesiek $20 million over three years, even though his 7 million Twitch followers has translated into less than a million on the nascent platform. This in addition to the money publishers like Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard, pays for Grzesiek to play their games on stream. Blevins himself is getting in on the pay-to-play action, receiving reported $1 million in February for a few hours playing&nbsp;<em>Fortnite </em>competitor&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends</em>.</p>

<h3 class="subhead3-embed color-body bg-base font-accent">Earnings: $17 million</h3>
<p><strong>The top gamer</strong> was everywhere in 2019, from Red Bull cans in grocery stores to bedding in Walmart to starring roles in NFL commercials. While his viewership fell, his influence didn’t, with endorsements from Adidas, Red Bull and underwear designer PSD. His exclusivity deal with Microsoft is helping to reshape the live-streaming landscape. And the good times seem to be continuing. This month,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite </em>maker Epic Games released an in-game Ninja avatar that fans can play as.</p>

Kjellberg remains as popular as ever, though, pulling in a staggering 4.5 billion views in 2019.</p>
