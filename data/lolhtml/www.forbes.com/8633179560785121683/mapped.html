<p>The coronavirus is likely to have a bigger economic impact than previous outbreaks thanks to a rapidly growing Chinese economy and its deeper commercial ties to the U.S. In 2003, when the SARS virus hit, China’s GDP was $1.6 trillion. Today, China’s GDP sits around $13 trillion.</p> 
<p>Over that period, China has been a growth hub for U.S. companies looking for ways to boost their bottom lines. Now those companies are on the front lines of a growing health pandemic that’s infected nearly 10,000 people and killed at least 213.&amp;nbsp; Some U.S businesses, like gaming giant Las Vegas Sands Corp. (which is seeing an 80% drop in visitors at its Macau locations amid the outbreak), had no operations when SARS hit in 2003. Earlier this week, the billionaire chairman of Las Vegas Sands, Sheldon Adelson, noted that all employees in the region are wearing masks, and visitors are being screened for an increased temperature, which could indicate possible infection.</p> 
 
<p>How much it will cost the casino giant will be clearer in the second quarter.</p> 
<p>“I think it would be foolhardy to think we can reduce costs enough to offset a continuing 80% decline. That's a real problem for any operator,” president and COO of Las Vegas Sands, Rob Goldstein, told analysts.</p>
