No, you will not get served the obligatory canned quote from Matt Damon.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This is Ben Affleck, raw and vulnerable, talking extensively for the first time about getting sober (again) and trying to recalibrate his career (again).</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Affleck, Oscar-winning writer, director of the Oscar-winning “Argo,” better actor than you remember — and, yes, alcoholic, divorcé and <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">proud</em> possessor of a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a19483751/ben-affleck-phoenix-back-tattoo-real/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mythical back tattoo</a> — has four movies coming out this year.

Affleck plays a reluctant high school basketball coach with big problems — he’s a puffy, willful, fall-down drunk who blows up his marriage and lands in rehab.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">You read that correctly.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“People with compulsive behavior, and I am one, have this kind of basic discomfort all the time that they’re trying to make go away,” he said a couple of Sundays ago during a two-hour interview at a beachside spot in Los Angeles. “You’re trying to make yourself feel better with eating or drinking or sex or gambling or shopping or whatever. But that ends up making your life worse. Then you do more of it to make <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">that</em> discomfort go away. Then the real pain starts.

He said he still felt guilt but had moved past shame. “The biggest regret of my life is this divorce,” he continued, noticeably using the present tense. “Shame is really toxic. There is no positive byproduct of shame. It’s just stewing in a toxic, hideous feeling of low self-worth and self-loathing.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He took a sharp breath and exhaled slowly, as if to slow himself down. “It’s not particularly healthy for me to obsess over the failures — the relapses — and beat myself up,” he said. “I have certainly made mistakes. I have certainly done things that I regret. But you’ve got to pick yourself up, learn from it, learn some more, try to move forward.”</p></div><aside class="css-ew4tgv" aria-label="companion column"></aside></div><div class="css-79elbk" data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div class="css-z3e15g" data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper-hidden"></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-children" class="css-1a48zt4 ehw59r15"><figure class="css-t9vhop e1g7ppur0" aria-label="media" role="group" itemProp="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemID="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/23/arts/23affleck7/merlin_168393930_77b6ecf8-e0d1-4df4-80d9-fe3803b57e68-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp" itemType="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><div class="css-1xdhyk6 erfvjey0"><span class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Image</span><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcSet="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/23/arts/23affleck7/merlin_168393930_77b6ecf8-e0d1-4df4-80d9-fe3803b57e68-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcSet="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/23/arts/23affleck7/merlin_168393930_77b6ecf8-e0d1-4df4-80d9-fe3803b57e68-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcSet="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/23/arts/23affleck7/merlin_168393930_77b6ecf8-e0d1-4df4-80d9-fe3803b57e68-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Why did he choose to make a movie about an alcoholic? “The benefits, to me, far outweighed the risks.

The hard truth is that the outcome is not guaranteed. Moviegoers, women in particular, will ultimately decide: Is forgiveness for transgressions still something that society in all of its Twitter-fied polarization allows? To some, Affleck is still the guy who broke Garner’s heart and who was <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/11/entertainment/ben-affleck-apology/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accused of groping</a> a talk-show host in 2013. “I acted inappropriately,” he said of that incident in 2017, as the #MeToo era dawned, “and I sincerely apologize.”</p><div id="NYT_MID_MAIN_CONTENT_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac"></div><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hollywood has certainly granted Affleck clemency.

Set in the 14th century, “The Last Duel” re-teams Affleck and Damon as screenwriters for the first time since “Good Will Hunting” in 1997; Ridley Scott is directing the film, which has Oscar bait written all over it. Disney plans to release “The Last Duel” in theaters at Christmas through its 20th Century label.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Affleck is also zeroing in on another directing project for himself.

(Affleck co-founded the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.easterncongo.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Eastern Congo Initiative</a>, a nonprofit advocacy group, in 2010.)</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Africa in 1900 is a long way from “The Batman,” which Affleck was supposed to direct himself.

(It was one of only two times when he chose each word carefully, with the other being his answer to a question about Harvey Weinstein’s trial on charges of rape and sexual assault. Early in his career, Affleck starred in multiple movies that were backed by Weinstein’s companies. “I don’t know that I have anything to really add or say that hasn’t been said already and better by people who have been personally victimized or who are survivors of what he did,” Affleck said. Three years ago, Affleck announced that he would <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://variety.com/2017/film/news/ben-affleck-weinstein-miramax-charity-1202608188/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">donate all future residual payments</a> from Weinstein films to anti-sexual assault charities.)</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The older I’ve gotten, the more I recognize that my dad did the best he could,” Affleck said. “There’s a lot of alcoholism and mental illness in my family.

No, I put a fake tattoo on my back and then hid it.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For the record, it’s not nearly as garish in person.</p><div class="css-79elbk" data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div class="css-z3e15g" data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper-hidden"></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-children" class="css-1a48zt4 ehw59r15"><figure class="css-1m53jiu e1g7ppur0" aria-label="media" role="group" itemProp="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemID="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/23/arts/23affleck6/23affleck6-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp" itemType="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><div class="css-zgakxe erfvjey0"><span class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Image</span><div class="css-zjzyr8"><div data-testid="lazyimage-container"></div></div></div><figcaption itemProp="caption description" class="css-1e7005o e1xdpqjp0"><span aria-hidden="true" class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">&ldquo;I resented that somebody got a picture of it by spying on me,&rdquo; Affleck said when asked why he wasn&rsquo;t forthright about his back tattoo.</span><span itemProp="copyrightHolder" class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><span class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</span><span>Backgrid</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Affleck has a habit of putting himself in the cross hairs. He thought it was a good idea to star (with Damon) as a fallen angel in Kevin Smith’s “Dogma” (1999), which Disney decided was <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/08/business/the-media-business-disney-and-miramax-collide-over-church-issues-in-new-film.html" title="">too blasphemous</a> for its Miramax label to release. Playing Batman as melancholy and middle-aged was certainly not the safe choice. “The Last Duel” has already provoked <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2019/07/23/ben-affleck-matt-damon-the-last-duel/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">indignation on social media</a>; Affleck and Damon play a knight and a squire who are forced to duel after a woman’s rape accusation.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And now comes “The Way Back,” a spare film with a 1970s vibe about a man imprisoned by alcoholism.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">How exactly does he make these choices?</p></div><aside class="css-ew4tgv" aria-label="companion column"></aside></div><div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Affleck laughed. “I’ve never been very risk-averse — for better or worse, obviously,” he said. “Regarding ‘The Way Back,’ the benefits, to me, far outweighed the risks. I found it very therapeutic.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The Way Back” was directed by Gavin O’Connor (“<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/14/movies/review-in-the-accountant-a-savant-with-daddy-issues-has-a-dark-secret.html" title="">The Accountant</a>,” also starring Affleck and a surprise hit) from a script by O’Connor and Brad Ingelsby (“<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/04/movies/out-of-the-furnace-with-christian-bale.html" title="">Out of the Furnace</a>”). It cost Warner Bros. and Bron Studios about $25 million to make and was primarily shot in San Pedro, a working-class area of Los Angeles.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I think that Ben, in an artistic way, in a deeply human way, wanted to confront his own issues through this character and heal,” O’Connor said by phone.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Jack Cunningham (Affleck) is a construction worker coping with devastating personal loss. His home away from home is a lowlife bar, the kind of place you can smell before you go in. Sometimes he holes up in his apartment to down cases of beer. He starts each morning by drinking beer in the shower, the can balanced on a sad soap caddy.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Without knowing the extent of his alcoholism, the principal at Jack’s alma mater asks him to coach the boys’ basketball team, which has even less self-esteem than he does. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.essence.com/celebrity/pretty-dope/melvin-gregg-is-a-different-kind-of-star/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Melvin Gregg</a> (“American Vandal”) stars as a player with off-court troubles.</p></div><aside class="css-ew4tgv" aria-label="companion column"></aside></div><div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The hardest part of the movie for Ben was really the basketball,” O’Connor said. “If you’ve never really played before, being on a court is like, you know, being on ice skates for the first time. Once that part clicked, we were cooking with gasoline. He was already ready to go to really deep, dark places with the drinking.”</p></div><aside class="css-ew4tgv" aria-label="companion column"></aside></div><div></div><div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Michaela Watkins (“Casual”) plays Jack’s worried sister. In one memorable scene, he sits in her kitchen pretending to be fine — <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">fine</em>. When she challenges him, he explodes. “Out of nowhere in one take, Ben backhanded the beer can sitting in front of him,” Watkins said by phone. “It was immediate, and it was scary and it was exactly the right instinct. He was a powder keg, and she had no idea that she had lit it.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Affleck talked about that moment, too.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“She’s pressing to see if he’s OK, and I know how uncomfortable that can be for an alcoholic — when you have that nagging, irritating, suspicious feeling that the person is right, but you don’t want to admit it. Smacking the can was my version of backed-into-a-corner, primal level of denial, the way our minds hold onto these addictions in a reptilian way.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Toward the end of “The Way Back” (spoiler alert) Jack has a powerful interaction with his ex-wife (Janina Gavankar, “The Morning Show”). He is in rehab at this point, and, when she comes to see how he is doing, he offers her an unflinching apology.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I failed you,” he says. “I failed our marriage.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It’s rough stuff, especially when watched through the prism of everything that has gone on with Affleck offscreen. You can’t help but think about similar conversations that he must have had with Garner.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It was really important, without being mawkish or false, that he make amends to her — that he take accountability for the pain that he and only he has caused,” Affleck said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">O’Connor said that Affleck had a “total breakdown” on set after completing the scene.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It was like a floodgate opened up,” O’Connor said. “It was startling and powerful. I think that was a very personal moment in the movie. I think that was him.”</p></div><aside class="css-ew4tgv" aria-label="companion column"></aside></div></section><!-- RELEASE dc5728f6d9fa07e63a62e4e09b7d99299c2cddd4 -->
