In the association’s 50 years of racing, the team was the first to complete a season using exclusively female drivers — and it finished the season in October in the top 10.</p></div><aside class="css-ew4tgv" aria-label="companion column"></aside></div><div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When Heinricher visited Caterpillar in September to discuss plans for this season, however, she was told the company had decided it would no longer bankroll her team. As the 2020 season got underway, Heinricher raced the clock to find a sponsor to keep her team together.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But another owner wooed away her drivers, leaving Heinricher to affect change as the only woman team owner and, at least this season, not from behind the wheel.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Auto racing has come a long way since the 1970s, when men threatened to boycott races if women were allowed to compete. There are highly qualified women behind the wheel, in the pits and on engineering teams, in numbers as never before. But finding sponsors for the necessary $3 million to $6 million in financing for teams, always a difficult part of racing, has been a barrier for women, who are often treated as marketing gimmicks rather than serious competitors.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Gimmick,” Heinricher said. “I hate that word.”</p></div><aside class="css-ew4tgv" aria-label="companion column"></aside></div><div class="css-79elbk" data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div class="css-z3e15g" data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper-hidden"></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-children" class="css-1a48zt4 ehw59r15"><figure class="css-1ef8w8q e1g7ppur0" aria-label="media" role="group" itemProp="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemID="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/13/sports/00racingwomen-04/merlin_149768475_3570cb98-50ee-45d0-a6e0-b16dfcbc23aa-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp" itemType="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><div class="css-1xdhyk6 erfvjey0"><span class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Image</span><img alt="Pit workers pushing the Heinricher Racing car during preparations for the Rolex 24. " class="css-1m50asq" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/13/sports/00racingwomen-04/merlin_149768475_3570cb98-50ee-45d0-a6e0-b16dfcbc23aa-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcSet="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/13/sports/00racingwomen-04/merlin_149768475_3570cb98-50ee-45d0-a6e0-b16dfcbc23aa-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/13/sports/00racingwomen-04/merlin_149768475_3570cb98-50ee-45d0-a6e0-b16dfcbc23aa-jumbo.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/13/sports/00racingwomen-04/merlin_149768475_3570cb98-50ee-45d0-a6e0-b16dfcbc23aa-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" itemProp="url" itemID="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/13/sports/00racingwomen-04/merlin_149768475_3570cb98-50ee-45d0-a6e0-b16dfcbc23aa-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"/></div><figcaption itemProp="caption description" class="css-18crmh6 e1xdpqjp0"><span aria-hidden="true" class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Pit workers pushing the Heinricher Racing car during preparations for the Rolex 24. </span><span itemProp="copyrightHolder" class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><span class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</span><span>Hilary Swift for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div class="css-a7yk8a e73j0it0"><figure class="css-kyszhr e1g7ppur0" aria-label="media" role="group" itemProp="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemID="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/13/sports/00racingwomen-02/00racingwomen-02-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp" itemType="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><div class="css-1xdhyk6 erfvjey0"><span class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Image</span><div class="css-zjzyr8"><div data-testid="lazyimage-container"></div></div></div><figcaption itemProp="caption description" class="css-1l6g02d e1xdpqjp0"><span aria-hidden="true" class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Jackie Heinricher, the team’s owner, monitoring the race.</span><span itemProp="copyrightHolder" class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><span class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</span><span>Hilary Swift for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></figure><figure class="css-kyszhr e1g7ppur0" aria-label="media" role="group" itemProp="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemID="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/13/sports/00racingwomen-03/merlin_149768415_e1044cf2-5ec9-4c09-9bb2-caea1b951d2d-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp" itemType="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><div class="css-1xdhyk6 erfvjey0"><span class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Image</span><div class="css-zjzyr8"><div data-testid="lazyimage-container"></div></div></div><figcaption itemProp="caption description" class="css-1l6g02d e1xdpqjp0"><span aria-hidden="true" class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Heinricher’s team finished 32 out of 47 over all at Daytona, and 12th out of 23 in their class.</span><span itemProp="copyrightHolder" class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><span class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</span><span>Hilary Swift for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Heinricher said she had sought to put together an all-female team “to demonstrate that women can compete head-to-head with their male counterparts and win if they have legitimate support.”</p></div><aside class="css-ew4tgv" aria-label="companion column"></aside></div><div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That should have attracted sponsors. Among her drivers was Katherine<strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"> </strong>Legge, who owns a track record at Laguna Seca, a marquee track in Northern California. There was also Simona De Silvestro, who has a win in the IndyCar series, which includes the Indianapolis 500. </p><div id="NYT_MID_MAIN_CONTENT_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac"></div><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Then there is Heinricher, the founder and president of BooShoot, which pioneered commercial bamboo production. She was the first woman to compete in the Lamborghini Super Trofeo. In 2017, she and Pippa Mann were the first all-female team in the Trofeo series, taking third in the pro-am event.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Heinricher Racing team made its debut at the Rolex 24 at Daytona, an annual endurance race in late January 2019. The first all-female teams raced there in 1966, when two teams of women drove small baby-blue Sunbeam Alpines for an oil company sponsor that called them the “Ring-Free Motor Maids.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One of those drivers, Janet Guthrie, would become the first woman to compete in the Daytona 500 and the Indianapolis 500. But the 1966 campaign “was embarrassing,” she said in a telephone interview, because the women had no hope of contending with such underpowered cars. The all-female teams came in third from last and last, but ahead of 26 cars that did not finish. </p></div><aside class="css-ew4tgv" aria-label="companion column"></aside></div><div></div><div></div><div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Back then, using women as an attention-getting stunt was considered smart marketing. But as recently as 2016, Bernie Ecclestone, the chief executive of Formula One at the time, told the Canadian network TSN that a female driver “would not be taken seriously.” That was years after Danica Patrick had won an IndyCar race and earned the pole position at the Daytona 500. Patrick, who retired in 2018, got plenty of sponsorship and media attention, but a healthy portion of it played up her sex appeal rather than her driving skill.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The motor sports industry has made efforts to battle the perception it isn’t female-friendly — creating commissions and diversity programs — but tangible change has been harder to come by. In June, for example, when Heinricher Racing applied for a spot in 24 Hours of Le Mans, one of sport’s most prestigious events, it was turned down.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Asked why in a BBC interview, Michelle Mouton, president of the Women’s Commission for the racing governing body, said she had been told one female team was the limit. “It was the answer I got,” she said. “‘We can have only one.’”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The chosen team, Kessel Racing, was held up as an example of how egalitarian racing had become. An <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.lemans.org/en/news/kessel-racing-proves-motorsport-isnt-just-for-men/52388" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">article</a> on the LeMans website carried the headline, “Kessel Racing Proves That Motorsport Isn’t Just for Men.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Caterpillar later told Heinricher in an email that one of its reasons for parting ways with her team was her inability to get its car into LeMans. “An all-female team has been invited and raced in the LeMans, so now it is not a first that we can promote,” the email said.</p></div><aside class="css-ew4tgv" aria-label="companion column"></aside></div><div></div><div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The organizations governing LeMans denied that there was sexual discrimination, and Heinricher publicly shrugged it off.</p></div><aside class="css-ew4tgv" aria-label="companion column"></aside></div><div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“You could call it sexism, you could say it’s discriminatory, you could say many things,” she told the BBC, “but the fact is that we’re not privy to the room.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In interviews, Heinricher carefully parses what she says, concerned that being outspoken might count against her as a team owner who needs to court sponsors. She even expressed reservations about being interviewed for this article, saying, “I don’t want this to become a controversy.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Caterpillar did not respond to multiple requests for comment about Heinricher and the decision to drop her team.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the 11th-hour lack of sponsors cost Heinricher: Her drivers were recruited to another team for this season.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Heinricher remains the only woman team owner in the International Motor Sports Association, one of the primary organizers of auto racing, and Exxon Mobil last month committed to the team, although all the drivers will be men.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Part of the difficulty Heinricher had in attracting sponsors could be that women remain a small percentage of the racing audience, and where there is diversity, it has not translated into significantly larger audiences. The National Hot Rod Association, for example, has a long history of female champions.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There is not a more diverse group, and it hasn’t helped them,” said Ron Schneider, chief executive of Sport Dimension, which specializes in race marketing. “Why didn’t the N.H.R.A. take off if this is important?”</p></div><aside class="css-ew4tgv" aria-label="companion column"></aside></div><div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The W Series, an all-female Formula Three circuit that began this year in Europe as part of an effort to get more women into racing, eliminated the sponsorship concern by raising the money itself to pay 20 drivers and supply them with cars.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The system was criticized at first by some notable racers, including Mann, a British driver who has competed at six Indianapolis 500s.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Those with funding to help female racers are choosing to segregate them as opposed to supporting them,” Mann wrote on Twitter, adding the hashtag #HandmaidsRacingSeries.</p></div><aside class="css-ew4tgv" aria-label="companion column"></aside></div><div></div><div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By the end of the first season in August, though, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/06/sports/autoracing/w-series-women-f1.html" title="">many doubters had been won over</a>. The W Series fielded credible drivers and proved to be sincere about providing women a long-term path to Formula One.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">  </span></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Heinricher said she remained undaunted in trying to usher more women into the top ranks of racing. She is mentoring Loni Unser, the 22-year-old fourth-generation progeny of the Unser racing dynasty who is in lower-tier races this season.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“What I want is to engage true talent,” she said. “I have my eyes on young female drivers, but it’s not enough to be a girl driver. You have to be a girl driver who wins.”</p></div><aside class="css-ew4tgv" aria-label="companion column"></aside></div><div></div></section><!-- RELEASE dc5728f6d9fa07e63a62e4e09b7d99299c2cddd4 -->
