In Western countries, they are often owned and operated by people from the Middle East or South Asia, where use of the hookah is a centuries-old tradition. </p><p>Some of those killed were of Turkish origin, a spokesman for the Turkish presidency said. &ldquo;We expect German authorities to show maximum effort to enlighten this case. Racism is a collective cancer,&rdquo; Ibrahim Kalin said on Twitter. </p><div class="RelatedCoverage_related-coverage-module module RelatedCoverage_two-column"><h4 class="RelatedCoverage_related-coverage-title">Related Coverage</h4><ul><li><a class="RelatedCoverage_item-container RelatedCoverage_black" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-shooting-victims/many-victims-of-shooting-in-germany-had-immigrant-background-report-idUSKBN20E172"><div class="RelatedCoverage_related-image"></div><div><span class="RelatedCoverage_related-headline">Many victims of shooting in Germany had immigrant background: report</span></div></a></li><li><a class="RelatedCoverage_item-container RelatedCoverage_black" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-shooting-cdu/leader-of-merkels-party-says-xenophobia-is-poisoning-our-society-idUSKBN20E1HJ"><div class="RelatedCoverage_related-image"></div><div><span class="RelatedCoverage_related-headline">Leader of Merkel&#x27;s party says xenophobia is poisoning our society</span></div></a></li></ul></div><p>German magazine Focus cited security sources as saying many of the victims had an immigrant background. </p><p>Germany&rsquo;s political landscape has been polarized in recent years, with a wave of immigration and a slowing economy helping to fuel support for extremist groups at both ends of the spectrum. </p><p>In October, an anti-Semitic gunman opened fire outside a German synagogue on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year, and killed two people as he livestreamed his attack. </p><p>Authorities have banned some far-right groups endorsing violence, while Germany&rsquo;s post-war centrist political consensus has been undermined by growing support for the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, notably in the former-Communist eastern states. </p><h3>&lsquo;THEY WERE HORRIFIED&rsquo;  </h3><p>Police said there were no indications that other suspects were involved in the Hanau attack. </p><div class="Image_container" tabindex="-1"><figure class="Image_zoom"><div class="LazyImage_container LazyImage_dark"><img src="//s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&amp;d=20200220&amp;t=2&amp;i=1492811349&amp;r=LYNXMPEG1J0WQ&amp;w=20" aria-label="Flowers and candles are placed near the Midnight Shisha bar after a shooting in Hanau, near Frankfurt, Germany, February 20, 2020.
