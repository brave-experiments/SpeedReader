He defended his record and argued he had the best chance of beating Republican President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election. </p><p>Rivals Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar, Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg all leaped at the chance to go after the media mogul, who has surged in polls by spending hundreds of millions of dollars out of his own pocket on an advertising blitz. </p><p>They criticized Bloomberg, who has been accused over the years of sexist comments, for his treatment of women as well as his support while mayor of &ldquo;stop-and-frisk&rdquo; police policies that ensnared disproportionate numbers of blacks and Latinos. </p><p>The candidates also accused Bloomberg of trying to buy his way into the White House and said his record as mayor and businessman was not good enough to beat Trump. </p><p>&ldquo;Democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another,&rdquo; said Warren, a senator from Massachusetts who had her most aggressive debate. </p><p>Nevada&rsquo;s caucuses are the third contest in the state-by-state race to find a challenger to Trump. South Carolina holds its primary on Feb. 29.  </p><p>Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has a town hall meeting and a fundraiser scheduled in Los Angeles, and Bloomberg has a morning event in Utah. </p><div class="Slideshow_container Slideshow_small Slideshow_standard"><div class="Slideshow_preview-container"><figure><div class="LazyImage_container LazyImage_dark"><img src="//s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&amp;d=20200220&amp;t=2&amp;i=1492755794&amp;r=LYNXMPEG1J0KM"/><div class="LazyImage_image LazyImage_fallback"></div></div><div class="Slideshow_expand-button" role="button" tabindex="0"><svg height="18px" width="18px" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 18 18" focusable="false"><path d="M16.2928932,1 L12.5,1 C12.2238576,1 12,0.776142375 12,0.5 C12,0.223857625 12.2238576,0 12.5,0 L17.5,0 C17.7761424,0 18,0.223857625 18,0.5 L18,5.5 C18,5.77614237 17.7761424,6 17.5,6 C17.2238576,6 17,5.77614237 17,5.5 L17,1.70710678 L12.8535534,5.85355339 C12.6582912,6.04881554 12.3417088,6.04881554 12.1464466,5.85355339 C11.9511845,5.65829124 11.9511845,5.34170876 12.1464466,5.14644661 L16.2928932,1 Z M1,16.2928932 L5.14644661,12.1464466 C5.34170876,11.9511845 5.65829124,11.9511845 5.85355339,12.1464466 C6.04881554,12.3417088 6.04881554,12.6582912 5.85355339,12.8535534 L1.70710678,17 L5.5,17 C5.77614237,17 6,17.2238576 6,17.5 C6,17.7761424 5.77614237,18 5.5,18 L0.5,18 C0.223857625,18 0,17.7761424 0,17.5 L0,12.5 C0,12.2238576 0.223857625,12 0.5,12 C0.776142375,12 1,12.2238576 1,12.5 L1,16.2928932 Z"></path></svg></div></figure><figcaption class="Slideshow_caption">Slideshow<span class="Slideshow_count"> (10 Images)</span></figcaption><span class="Slideshow_line"></span></div></div><p>Warren and Biden will have a town hall that airs on CNN on Thursday night from Las Vegas.
