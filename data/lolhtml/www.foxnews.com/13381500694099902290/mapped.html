Goldberg added: &quot;And we have carried this fight.&quot; She referred specifically to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and&#xA0;Sen.

Pelosi had downplayed the &quot;squad&apos;s&quot; political power after they voted against a bipartisan measure funding immigration enforcement agencies.</p><p>Ocasio-Cortez responded by criticizing Pelosi for targeting a group of women of color.</p><p>During Wednesday&apos;s show, Ocasio-Cortez downplayed the conflict, suggesting that the media tended to exaggerate feuds in the Democratic Party. Pelosi was &quot;Mama Bear of the Democratic Party, you don&apos;t mess with her,&quot; Ocasio-Cortez said. She also suggested that she faced a substantial amount of pushback because the political system is controlled by &quot;rich men,&quot; who were not her priority as a congresswoman.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pelosi-comments-on-public-spat-with-alexandria-ocasio-cortez" target="_blank"><strong>PELOSI RESPONDS TO AOC SLAM, SAYS CAUCUS HAS HER BACK FOR CONDEMNING CHIEF OF STAFF&apos;S &apos;OFFENSIVE&apos; TWEET</strong></a></p><p>When the conflict initially surfaced last year, &quot;The View&quot; admonished Ocasio-Cortez for those comments.</p><p>&quot;I think this is more BS,&quot; Goldberg said after mentioning the race accusation. During that episode from July,&#xA0;Goldberg was annoyed that younger lawmakers were criticizing how effective Pelosi, Feinstein, and other older Democrats had been in effecting change.</p><p>She went on to send a message to younger members of Congress: &quot;Please remember that the people who are here now &#x2014;&#xA0;all you young people, you&apos;re&#xA0;on the shoulders of a whole bunch of people who came before you. And you have to stop discounting that.&quot;</p><div originalImageUrl="https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/23/694940094001_6088659575001_6088650769001-vs.jpg" class="embed-media fn-video"><div class="video-container"><div data-widget-type="embed" data-video-id="6088650769001" data-video-domain="foxnews" class="m video-player"><a href="http://video.foxnews.com/v/6088650769001"><img src="https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/23/694940094001_6088659575001_6088650769001-vs.jpg" alt="AOC lashes out at Democrats' failure to impeach President Trump"><span class="overlay">Video</span></a></div></div></div><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joy-behar" target="_blank">Co-host Joy Behar</a>&#xA0;expressed grief over the squad&apos;s criticism, telling them to focus on getting&#xA0;<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank">President Trump</a>&#xA0;out of the White House. &quot;Ladies, ladies. It&apos;s like &#x2014;&#xA0;it&apos;s disheartening. It&apos;s like the enemy is the guy tweeting in his toilet,&quot; Behar said.

Let&apos;s keep this in mind, do you think Nancy Pelosi wanted to pass a half-assed bill? No, the moderates were the problem and I would say to these women.&quot;</p><p>She appeared to be referring to the border funding bill that fueled a lot of the controversy surrounding&#xA0;Ocasio-Cortez and others in the party.</p><p>She added that if Ocasio-Cortez and others did not try to reach out&#xA0;and persuade&#xA0;moderates, they shouldn&apos;t complain about legislation.</p><p>&quot;If you&apos;re not going to do that, you&apos;re not allowed to b---h about this.&quot;</p></div><div class="article-meta"><div class="author-bio">Sam Dorman is a reporter with Fox News.
