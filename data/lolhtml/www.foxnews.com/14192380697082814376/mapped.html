I&#x2019;m bruised, I&#x2019;m battered, and I&#x2019;m bloody,&#x201D; Blagojevich said, patting his chin with a napkin. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s been a long time since I&#x2019;ve shaved with a normal razor.

He couldn&#x2019;t find where I put his socks this morning.&#x201D;</p><p>The brash politician whose corruption-case sentence of 14 years was cut short a day earlier by Trump&apos;s decision went on to say,&#xA0;&#x201C;We want to thank and give our most profound and everlasting gratitude to President Trump.&#x201D; He thanked Trump for giving back the freedom he said was &quot;stolen&quot; from him.</p><p>Noting they are from different parties, he said Trump&apos;s commutation decision &#x201C;does nothing to help his politics.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Trump is a man who is tough and outspoken, but he also has a kind heart,&#x201D; he continued. &#x201C;This is an act of kindness and I believe this is the beginning of the process to turn an injustice into justice.&#x201D;</p><p>He added: &#x201C;Sorry about this blood.&#x201D;</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-to-commute-sentence-of-ex-gov-blagojevich-pardon-kerik" target="_blank">TRUMP COMMUTES BLAGO SENTENCE, PARDONS KERIK</a></strong></p><p>Blagojevich, after having served eight years of his sentence, went on to describe his first three years in prison, explaining that he was &#x201C;behind what inmates call a razor wire ... with guards armed with machine guns who have the discretion to shoot you.&#x201D;</p><p>He noted he never went near the fence. He described where the inmates slept as &quot;cold and squalid,&quot; like &quot;tombs.&quot; He said many of the inmates were cartel members, sex offenders and other violent criminals, describing his cell as a &quot;six-by-eight-foot&quot; room with a heavy iron door and a small window.</p><p>&#x201C;Often late in the night, I&#x2019;d look out past [the window] and think of home,&#x201D; he said, describing his hope to someday return to his wife. &#x201C;I would say to myself, &apos;One day, one day I&#x2019;ll make it back to you and hold your hand, sweetheart,&apos; and I would remember what a gracious thing it&#x2019;s been to walk through life with you.&#x201D;</p><p>Blagojevich continued touting Trump&#xA0;as &#x201C;tough and outspoken,&#x201D; but said &#x201C;he gets things done.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s a problem solver, where too many politicians don&#x2019;t want to solve problems,&#x201D; he said, noting that if he were to have the ability to vote, he would cast his ballot in November 2020 for Trump.</p><p>Blagojevich, who was a contestant on Trump&#x2019;s &#x201C;Celebrity Apprentice&#x201D; in 2010, began his 14-year prison sentence in 2012, after being convicted of corruption.&#xA0;Blagojevich had&#xA0;been serving his sentence at a federal prison in Littleton, Colo.</p><p>Blagojevich, who was governor of Illinois from 2003 to 2009, was impeached and also convicted on 18 counts, including lying to the FBI and&#xA0;wire fraud, for trying to trade an appointment to Barack Obama&apos;s Senate seat for contributions, and for the attempted extortion of a children&#x2019;s hospital executive. The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago in 2015 tossed five of 18 convictions, including ones in which he offered to appoint someone to a high-paying job in the Senate.</p><p>He has consistently argued that he did nothing wrong.</p><p>Blagojevich&#x2019;s wife, Patti, went on a media blitz in 2018 to encourage Trump to step in, praising the president and likening the investigation of her husband to special prosecutor Robert Mueller&apos;s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election &#x2013;&#xA0;a probe Trump long characterized as a &quot;witch hunt.&quot;</p><p>On Tuesday, Trump confirmed to reporters that he granted clemency for the ex-governor, calling his sentence &#x201C;ridiculous.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;ll be able to go back home with his family after serving eight years in jail,&#x201D; Trump said.</p><p>&quot;Many people disagreed with the sentence,&quot; Trump told reporters.</p><p>Trump also expressed sympathy for the former Illinois governor&apos;s children.</p><p>&quot;Very far from his children,&quot; Trump said. &quot;They rarely get to see their father outside of an orange uniform. I saw that and I did commute his sentence.&quot;</p><p>Trump first floated the idea of commuting Blagojevich&#x2019;s sentence in May 2018, after pardoning conservative filmmaker Dinesh D&#x2019;Souza. At the time, Trump called Blagojevich&#x2019;s sentence &#x201C;really unfair.&#x201D;</p><p>Trump also announced on Tuesday that he pardoned financier Michael Milken, who pleaded guilty for violating U.S. securities laws. Trump also pardoned former New York City Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik,&#xA0;who was sentenced on tax fraud charges in 2010, on Tuesday.</p><p><em>Fox News&apos; Tyler Olson, John Roberts and The Associated Press contributed to this report.&#xA0;</em></p></div><div class="article-meta"><div class="author-bio">Brooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.
