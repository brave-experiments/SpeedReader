providers to target suburbs, where they can cover the most people per drone. Then they could move on to<strong> </strong>more remote areas. "They [network providers] are willing to pay for a product that can do it," he says. "It's good business and it happens to be good for the world."</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Each drone can provide high-quality internet for several hundred people over a radius of between 20 miles and 30 miles, says Tiwari, so remote areas may only need one drone, while suburbs<strong> </strong>may need several. The drones cost from $40,000 and are fully automated in flight, but would have a pilot for take-off and landing. Tiwari adds that some countries require more oversight from a pilot.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Spooky Action has run tests with <span>Verizon</span> <span>(<span class="inlink_chart"><a href="https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=VZ&source=story_quote_link" class="inlink">VZ</a></span>)</span> and <span>Orange</span> <span>(<span class="inlink_chart"><a href="https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=FNCTF&source=story_quote_link" class="inlink">FNCTF</a></span>)</span>, <a href="https://medium.com/@SpookyAction/spooky-action-and-orange-demonstrate-a-revolutionary-virtual-reality-experience-at-the-french-6be951c8dc07" target="_blank">which used Telelift to deliver internet</a> to the French National Windsurfing Championships in Quiberon, France, last November.
