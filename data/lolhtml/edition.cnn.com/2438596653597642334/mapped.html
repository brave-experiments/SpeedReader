He pardoned Bernie Kerik, the former New York police commissioner who was convicted of tax fraud. And in another controversial move, he pardoned a fellow kingpin of 1980s New York, the junk bond entrepreneur Michael Milken, convicted of conspiracy to hide stocks and tax fraud.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">The moves were the latest examples of Trump's willingness to use his pardon power -- that many Presidents only fully utilize on the way out of the Oval Office door -- to political advantage in the middle of his administration.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">His aggressive use of constitutional but still highly provocative presidential power also sparked speculation he would next move to political associates caught up in the Russia probe. And it was the latest extraordinary example of untamed executive power that suggests the President is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/12/politics/donald-trump-justice-department-roger-stone/index.html" target="_blank">feeling invincible</a> now he has been delivered from the impeachment storm.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Tuesday's developments were also a fresh indication that he is intensifying his attacks on institutions that challenge his power, with the courts becoming an increasingly frequent target.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">"What the President has discovered is that he can do pretty much whatever he wants, within reason," Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor told CNN.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Trump's latest moves are likely to alarm critics who see his own questionable legal behavior and record of stretching his powers to the limit as a historic threat to the US legal system.

Arpaio</a> who was convicted of criminal contempt over his harsh immigration policies.

Lewis "Scooter" Libby</a>, the chief of staff to former Vice President Dick Cheney who was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice in a case over the leaking of a former CIA officer's identity.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">The President's latest decisions came two days before his political trickster, Stone, is due to be sentenced, and days after the Justice Department reversed recommendations for how long he should spend in jail following Trump's angry complaints.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">"I'm allowed to be totally involved," the President told reporters before heading off on a western campaign swing.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"><h3>Trump is undoing years of government prosecutions</h3></div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">In the last few days, in a new activation of always-implied presidential powers, Trump has effectively assumed the authority to undo complex prosecutions, ignore jury decisions and usurp government prosecutors who put years into high-profile cases. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">In the process, he's sent a message that convicts with associates who are close to the President politically -- or who can get on Fox News -- will enjoy a more lenient form of justice.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Kerik, for example, is a protege of Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani — who was at the center of <a href="http://www.cnn.com/specials/politics/trump-impeachment" target="_blank">the effort to get dirt from Ukraine</a> on Trump's opponents that led to his impeachment.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Blagojevich's wife has often taken to the President's favorite conservative news network to plead his case. And the White House noted in a statement that Milkin's philanthropy had led conservative heroes like Giuliani, Sheldon Adelson and House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy to support calls for a pardon.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Trump's recent interventions in the legal process also opened a window into the President's personal morality and the principles which govern his own attitudes to power.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Kerik, Blagojevich and Milken were all convicted of offenses that the President has been accused of committing by his enemies. Their cases involved a blizzard of abuses of power, betraying public trust, soliciting quid pro quo, fogging tax records and lying to investigators.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">It is almost as if Trump is arguing implicitly that such corruption should not be criminal at all, but is the normal behavior of powerful men -- such as himself.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">It was also notable that Trump specifically noted that Blagojevich was put behind bars by US Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald, a star legal contemporary of Trump's nemesis, fired former FBI Director James Comey. Fitzgerald prosecuted Libby as well and also joined Comey's legal team in 2017. That the President appears to be taking aim at those associations seems unlikely to be a coincidence.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Trump's swipe also represented an escalation of his war on government prosecutors in general -- four of whom <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/11/politics/roger-stone-sentencing-justice-department/index.html" target="_blank">walked off the Stone case</a> after the Justice Department capitulated to his wishes last week.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">The President has spent years building a conceit that the instruments of impartial justice are in fact themselves corrupt and that their investigations into his own and his associates' transgressions are part of a deep state plot to overthrow him.</div><div class="ad ad--epic ad--mobile" data-ad-text="show"><div data-ad-id="ad_rect_btf_01" data-ad-position="mobile" data-ad-refresh="default"></div></div><ul class="cn cn-list-hierarchical-xs cn--idx-35 cn-zoneAdContainer" data-layout="list-hierarchical-xs"></ul><div class="zn-body__paragraph">It would surprise no one in Washington if, having prepared the public for aggressive interventions in the legal system, the President turns to cases that reflect on him directly, like those against Stone, jailed former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and disgraced <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2020/02/14/politics/william-barr-michael-flynn/index.html" target="_blank">former national security adviser Michael Flynn</a>.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">The President insisted on Tuesday that he had not even thought about pardoning Stone -- an assertion that was being treated with skepticism in Washington Tuesday night.</div></div><p class="zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer"></p></div></section><div class="pg-body__social"></div><section class="zn zn-ad-spon-1mkkh7t zn-left-fluid zn--idx-3 zn--ordinary zn-left-fluid-share zn-has-one-container" data-eq-pts="xsmall: 0, medium: 460, large: 780, full16x9: 1100" id="ad-spon-1mkkh7t" data-vr-zone="zone-1-3" data-containers="1"><div class="zn-top "><div class="l-container zn-top__label"></div><div class="l-container zn-top__banner"></div><div class="zn-top__background"></div></div><div class="l-container"><div class="zn__containers"><div class="column zn__column--idx-0"><div class="ad ad--epic ad--desktop" data-ad-text="show"><div id="ad_bnr_btf_02" class="ad-ad_bnr_btf_02 ad-refresh-adbody"></div></div><ul class="cn cn-list-hierarchical-xs cn--idx-0 cn-zoneAdContainer" data-layout="list-hierarchical-xs"></ul></div></div></div></section></div><!-- --><!-- --><!-- -->
