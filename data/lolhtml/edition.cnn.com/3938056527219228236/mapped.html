</div></div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Because the Covid-19 virus has infected far more people than the viruses that caused SARS and MERS, the number of people who have died from it so far has already overtaken both viruses.<strong> </strong>The SARS outbreak claimed the lives of 774 people, while MERS has killed <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/07/09/health/mers-fast-facts/index.html" target="_blank">at least 828 people</a> since 2012. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Even so, flu has led to far more deaths than all of these viruses combined -- killing tens of thousands of people in the US each year -- due to its massive spread.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">The latest death toll from Covid-19 is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-02-18-20-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank">over 1,800</a>, all but five of which occurred in mainland China, where the worst of the outbreak is centered. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Many of those deaths have been among older people and those with preexisting conditions that make them more susceptible to serious illness from viral infections. The Chinese CDC study found that among patients aged 80 and above, the crude fatality rate is 14.8%. Among those with pre-existing conditions, those with cardiovascular disease were found to be most at risk, with a fatality rate of 10.5%.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">The contagious nature of the virus has also put medical workers at risk -- as of February 11, more than 3,000 hospital staff or other medics had been reported to have been infected with the virus, among whom 1,716 had been confirmed by nucleic acid tests. Of the confirmed cases, only a small number has resulted in death -- roughly 0.3%, according to the authors.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Release of the study comes as Chinese officials were hailing what seemed to be the turning of a corner in the fight against the virus. Outside of Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak, the number of new cases reported has fallen for the past 14-days. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">However, scientists previously warned of self-sustaining epidemics in Chinese cities, and both Beijing and Shanghai remain on tight lockdown to guard against the virus' spread. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">While<strong> </strong>the number of new reported cases have gone down in China and some other countries, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that new data must be analyzed "cautiously."</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">"This trend must be interpreted very cautiously. Trends can change as new populations are affected. It's too early to tell if this reported decline will continue. Every scenario is still on the table," Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of WHO, said during a press conference Monday.</div><div class="ad ad--epic ad--mobile" data-ad-text="show"><div data-ad-id="ad_rect_btf_01" data-ad-position="mobile" data-ad-refresh="default"></div></div><ul class="cn cn-list-hierarchical-xs cn--idx-23 cn-zoneAdContainer" data-layout="list-hierarchical-xs"></ul><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Tedros added that more than 80% of patients "have mild disease and will recover."</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">"In about 14% of cases, the virus causes severe diseases including pneumonia and shortness of breath. And about 5% of patients have critical diseases including respiratory failure, septic shock and multiorgan failure," he said. "In 2% of reported cases, the virus is fatal, and the risk of death increases the older you are. We see relatively few cases among children. More research is needed to understand why."</div></div><p class="zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer"></p></div></section><div class="pg-body__social"></div><section class="zn zn-ad-spon-1ttyupq zn-left-fluid zn--idx-3 zn--ordinary zn-left-fluid-share zn-has-one-container" data-eq-pts="xsmall: 0, medium: 460, large: 780, full16x9: 1100" id="ad-spon-1ttyupq" data-vr-zone="zone-1-3" data-containers="1"><div class="zn-top "><div class="l-container zn-top__label"></div><div class="l-container zn-top__banner"></div><div class="zn-top__background"></div></div><div class="l-container"><div class="zn__containers"><div class="column zn__column--idx-0"><div class="ad ad--epic ad--desktop" data-ad-text="show"><div id="ad_bnr_btf_02" class="ad-ad_bnr_btf_02 ad-refresh-adbody"></div></div><ul class="cn cn-list-hierarchical-xs cn--idx-0 cn-zoneAdContainer" data-layout="list-hierarchical-xs"></ul></div></div></div></section></div><!-- --><!-- -->
