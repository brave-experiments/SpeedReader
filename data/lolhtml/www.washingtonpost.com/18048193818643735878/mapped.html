Barr, who has told people close to the president that he is willing to quit unless Trump stops publicly commenting on ongoing criminal matters, according to two administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. It also has appalled several legal experts and former officials, who have said his direct intervention in legal matters risks further politicizing law enforcement at a time of fraying confidence in the Justice Department.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">More than 2,000 former Justice Department employees <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/more-than-1100-ex-justice-department-officials-call-for-barrs-resignation/2020/02/16/d9b56d10-50c0-11ea-9e47-59804be1dcfb_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_8&itid=lk_inline_manual_8">signed a public letter this week </a>objecting to Trump’s public intervention in the case of his longtime friend Roger Stone, and urging Barr to resign.

Among the recipients of Trump’s largesse was Rod R. Blagojevich, the former Illinois governor who was convicted on corruption charges in 2011 related to trying to sell Obama’s vacated Senate seat. His sentence was commuted. Financier Michael Milken, who was charged with insider trading in the 1980s, and Bernie Kerik, the former New York police commissioner jailed on eight felony charges, including tax fraud, were pardoned.</p></div><div></div><div></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Trump said the pardons and commutations were based on “the recommendations of people that know them,” including Blagojevich’s wife, Patricia, who made a direct appeal to the president on Fox News.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Legal experts said that by relying on his personal connections rather than the Justice Department’s established review process for finding convicts deserving of clemency, Trump risked politicizing his pardon power.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">“It’s a clemency process for the well-connected, and that’s it,” said Rachel Barkow, a professor and clemency expert at the New York University School of Law. “Trump is wielding the power the way you would expect the leader of a banana republic who wants to reward his friends and cronies.”</p></div><div></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Trump’s comments about the Stone case have caused the most concern. Trump has singled out the judge in the case, Amy Berman Jackson of the U.S. District Court in Washington, for personal attacks, accusing her of bias and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/trump-takes-on-judge-amy-berman-jackson-ahead-of-roger-stones-sentencing/2020/02/12/753e2a6e-4db6-11ea-bf44-f5043eb3918a_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_12&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_12&tid=lk_inline_manual_22&itid=lk_inline_manual_22">spreading a falsehood about her record</a>. He has amplified Stone’s request for a new trial, accusing a member of the jury of being politically biased against him.</p></div><div></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Though Barr has warned that the president’s unbridled commentary about ongoing criminal cases was making it “impossible for me to do my job,” Trump continued to express his views about legal matters Tuesday.</p></div><div></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Trump told reporters that he partially agreed with Barr, acknowledging that his tweets do make the attorney general’s job more difficult. But he said he would continue tweeting nonetheless.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">“Social media, for me, has been very important because it gives me a voice,” Trump said.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">And he has made a direct connection between his own legal travails and those of Stone, who was convicted of lying to Congress about his attempts to get details from Hillary Clinton’s private emails from the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Trump’s increasingly provocative comments raised the prospect that he might issue pardons for Stone and former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Since his impeachment acquittal, Trump has tried to portray the prosecutions of his allies as the illegitimate product of an illegitimate investigation by former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III into Russian interference in the 2016 race.</p></div><div></div><div></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Prosecutions stemming from the Mueller investigation are “badly tainted,” Trump tweeted Tuesday, and “should be thrown out.”</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">“If I wasn’t President, I’d be suing everyone all over the place,” Trump wrote. “BUT MAYBE I STILL WILL. WITCH HUNT!”</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">After learning that federal judges would be holding an emergency discussion about his intervention in legal cases, Trump tweeted that they should instead discuss the alleged shortcomings of the Mueller probe.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Trump’s constant commentary and increasing willingness to flout traditional legal processes signal that the president feels emboldened and unrestrained after Republicans voted almost unanimously to acquit him on impeachment charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, said Chris Whipple, author of “The Gatekeepers,” a history of White House chiefs of staff.</p></div><div></div><div></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">“It shows that Susan Collins was right — Trump has learned a lesson,” Whipple said, referring to a prediction by the Republican senator from Maine that Trump would be more cautious after impeachment. “The lesson he learned is that he’s unaccountable. He can do whatever he wants now with impunity.”</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">While some Republicans spoke out against Trump’s commutation for Blagojevich, the reaction from GOP lawmakers Tuesday was mostly muted. And there’s little to indicate that pardons for Stone or Flynn would lead to a significant Republican backlash.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Whipple said the president’s decision to pardon several of his political allies just before Stone is scheduled to be sentenced set the stage for an increasingly “dangerous” phase of Trump’s presidency.</p></div><div></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">“This is a president who thinks the law exists to be circumvented,” he said.</p></div><div></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">The next test of Trump’s willingness to intervene in the legal process could come as soon as Thursday, when Stone is set to be sentenced by Jackson. Asked Tuesday if he would issue a pardon for Stone, Trump demurred.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">“I haven’t given it any thought. In the meantime, he’s going through a process,” Trump said. “But I think he’s been treated very unfairly.”</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md italic">Fred Barbash, Mark Berman, Carol D.
