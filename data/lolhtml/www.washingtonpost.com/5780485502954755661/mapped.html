Yes, it’s cold. But there’s no question we live on a warming planet. The cracks are starting to show: A recent Trump administration report said that the effects of climate change, including wildfires, hurricanes and heat waves, are already battering the United States. “I don’t think it takes a science degree to see what is happening in the world,” artist Jon Krause says. “Neil deGrasse Tyson had a great quote in ‘Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey’ discussing the mass extinction of species: ‘The dinosaurs never saw that asteroid coming.’ Climate change is our generation’s impending asteroid. Hopefully we can make the necessary changes to ensure our fate isn’t the same as theirs.”</p> <div class="ent-photo ent-photo-fullwidth"> <img class="unprocessed placeholder" data-hi-res-src="https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2018/12/1230_TOC_w.jpg&amp;w=988" data-low-res-src="https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2018/12/1230_TOC_w.jpg&amp;w=800" data-raw-src="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2018/12/1230_TOC_w.jpg" src="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2018/12/1230_TOC_w.jpg" /> <span class="ent-photo-caption ent-photo-fullwidth"></span> </div> <h3>‘Roller Coaster’</h3> <h4><a href="https://www.jeanjullien.com/">JEAN JULLIEN</a></h4> <p><strong>Dec. 30, 2018, issue:</strong> We all remember what it’s like to board a roller coaster for the first time. The sweaty palms. The pang of No Going Back once you get buckled into your seat by the attendant. The dizzying heights just as the ride crests. Maybe it isn’t all that different from confronting the arrival of a new year — especially given the rather tumultuous times in which we live. “As I grow older, I find that years go by much quicker,” artist Jean Jullien notes. “Too quick. At a scary pace, actually. And at the beginning of the year, you never know what it’s going to be like, but there’s no way of going back and no way of stopping the movement.”</p> <div class="ent-photo ent-photo-fullwidth"> <img class="unprocessed placeholder" data-hi-res-src="https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2018/12/1216_TOC_w.jpg&amp;w=988" data-low-res-src="https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2018/12/1216_TOC_w.jpg&amp;w=800" data-raw-src="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2018/12/1216_TOC_w.jpg" src="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2018/12/1216_TOC_w.jpg" /> <span class="ent-photo-caption ent-photo-fullwidth"></span> </div> <h3>‘Coming Home’</h3> <h4><a href="http://www.jeezvanilla.com/">ADRIANA BELLET</a></h4> <p><strong>Dec. 16, 2018, issue:</strong> Technology does wonders for staying in touch with loved ones when they’re far away.

For artist Lydia Ortiz, who was born in the Philippines, the concept of human rights first presented itself when, as a child, she visited the site of the Bataan Death March — the 1942 transfer of American and Filipino prisoners of war by the Japanese army. The lessons she learned about that historical episode continue to resonate with her as strongly as ever. “With all the critical conflicts happening in multiple nations today,” she says, “we should remind ourselves of our obligation to monitor and enforce human rights for all oppressed humans everywhere.”</p> <div class="ent-photo ent-photo-fullwidth"> <img class="unprocessed placeholder" data-hi-res-src="https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2018/12/1202_TOC_w.jpg&amp;w=988" data-low-res-src="https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2018/12/1202_TOC_w.jpg&amp;w=800" data-raw-src="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2018/12/1202_TOC_w.jpg" src="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2018/12/1202_TOC_w.jpg" /> <span class="ent-photo-caption ent-photo-fullwidth"></span> </div> <h3>‘December’</h3> <h4><a href="http://chloescheffe.github.io/">CHLOE SCHEFFE</a></h4> <p><strong>Dec. 2, 2018, issue:</strong> Sunlight diminishes.

The flower, consecrated by the celebrated poem, would become an enduring symbol of both sacrifice and the utter ruin of warfare, explains illustrator Matt Huynh of Brooklyn. “This Veterans Day coincides with the centenary of the end of WWI, the ‘war to end all wars,’ ” he notes. “This image reflects on that 100-year-old promise for peace with poppies.”</p> <div class="ent-photo ent-photo-fullwidth"> <img class="unprocessed placeholder" data-hi-res-src="https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2018/12/1104_TOC_w.jpg&amp;w=988" data-low-res-src="https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2018/12/1104_TOC_w.jpg&amp;w=800" data-raw-src="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2018/12/1104_TOC_w.jpg" src="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2018/12/1104_TOC_w.jpg" /> <span class="ent-photo-caption ent-photo-fullwidth"></span> </div> <h3>‘American Turf War’</h3> <h4><a href="http://ericpetersen.us.com/">ERIC PETERSEN</a></h4> <p><strong>Nov. 4, 2018, issue:</strong> Control of the U.S. House of Representatives hangs in the balance.

But, for New Mexico artist Eric Petersen, it’s just the latest round of stupefyingly zero-sum gamesmanship between our two major political parties. “This illustration was inspired by a very popular video game played by my 11-year-old son in which two opposing teams compete to cover the shared territory with their own color,” Petersen said. “The U.S. as a functioning entity is being erased by our partisan turf war.
