<p>After being pushed to the lead on the final lap, Ryan Newman put multiple blocks on Ryan Blaney, attempting to protect his lead and win the Daytona 500 for the second time. Contact with Blaney resulted in Newman's car being turned into the outside wall, and the impact turned Newman's car onto its roof and into oncoming traffic. Newman was then struck by the oncoming car of Corey LaJoie in the driver's side, flipping it back up into the air before it slid across the finish line upside down and on his roof.</p>
<p>Newman did not emerge from his car, as safety workers began the process of extricating him from the machine.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>Newman was transported to local Halifax Health, where he is undergoing treatment and evaluation in serious condition. Per a statement by Roush Fenway Racing shared by NASCAR's Steve O'Donnell, Newman's injuries are not considered life-threatening.</p>
<p>"Ryan Newman is being treated at Halifax Medical Center. He is in serious condition, but doctors have indicated his injuries are not life threatening," <a href="https://twitter.com/NASCAR/status/1229602665170112514?s=20" target="_blank"><strong>read a statement by NASCAR</strong></a>. "We appreciate your thoughts and prayers and ask that you respect the privacy of Ryan and his family during this time. We appreciate your patience and cooperation and we will provide more information as it becomes available."</p>
