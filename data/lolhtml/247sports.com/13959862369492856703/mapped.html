<p>Oregon Ducks football commit <b><a href="https://247sports.com//247sports.com/Player/Seven-McGee-46054004" target="_blank">Seven McGee</a></b> feels lucky to be alive after a serious car accident on Saturday night.</p>
<p>McGee, who is currently ranked as the 247Sports Composite No. 6 running back in the class of 2021, was involved in a car accident that heavily damaged the back of his vehicle. The running back recruit posted about the accident on his personal Twitter account Sunday.</p>
<p>In photos posted to his Twitter account, McGee is seen laying in a hospital bed with a neck brace.</p>
<p><span>"Could of lost my life last night .... The lord was truly with me God is good im so greatful man.. the lord really has blessed me," McGee wrote in the caption of his tweet. "Thanks for all who had prayers for me."</span></p>
<p><span>McGee attends Centennial High School (Corona, California), and he is ranked as the No. 88 overall player and No. 9 player in his state.</span></p>
<p><span><span>"McGee is a versatile offensive player who shows explosive playmaking ability at running back and receiver," writes 247Sports National Recruiting Analyst Greg Biggins. "Has both short area quickness and top-end speed, and is a threat to score from anywhere on the field. Shows a high level burst, can stop and start on a dime and has excellent feet and lateral cutting ability. Very tough to tackle one on one because of his shiftiness and ability to make a defender miss. Shows excellent hands out of the pocket and slot receiver is probably his best college position. A dangerous punt/kick returner and should be an immediate impact player on special teams. Shows natural pass-catching skills and is dangerous after the catch. Is an explosive leaper and very good in jump-ball situations. Needs to fill out some and add size and strength, but shows the ability to be a game breaker at the next level. Projects as a impact, upper-tier Power 5 starter and future high-round NFL draft pick."</span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p>McGee has been committed to Oregon since October 2018, and he told Biggins last week that his commitment remains strong. However, other schools have not stopped trying to change his mind.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;Yeah I&rsquo;m hearing from a lot of schools right now,&rdquo; McGee said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still committed to Oregon though and feel really good about them. I do plan to take a visit to LSU March 25. I&rsquo;ve been talking with coach (<b><a href="https://247sports.com//247sports.com/Coach/Ed-Orgeron-533" target="_blank">Ed Orgeron</a></b>) a lot, and he said he loves me as an athlete but wants to get me up to campus and meet me in person so I&rsquo;m looking forward to that.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m also hearing from USC, Texas, Utah, Colorado, Florida, Texas A&amp;M, Nebraska and a few others. In addition to LSU, I want to get out to Texas and Colorado, too, but don't have dates with them yet. I just know I want to see both schools and visit the campuses there."</span></p> <script>$tfs.Related.push({"Key":9640676,"Name":"Pac-12 Superlatives from National Signing Day","OriginalFilename":"1694573635560","Date":"2/6/2020 2:02:40 PM","Type":"cbs","Height":"0","Width":"0","FileSystem":"media","Path":"247sports-national-college-football-nashville-team","User":null,"Text":"Barton Simmons breaks it all down on the 247Sports Signing Day Show.","Class":"Video","Thumbnail":"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/api/content/image/1f61829e-9fb4-40ae-84eb-fa906d0524e8/resize/320x180.jpg","Duration":"83","AssetSource":null,"AssetExtension":null,"Host":"https://s3media.247sports.com","SystemPath":"C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\247sports","DefaultName":"Pac-12 Superlatives from National Signing Day","Tags":[],"Location":"Headline Content"});</script> <script>$tfs.Related.push({"Key":9650492,"Name":"Highlights: Biggest and best dunks from football recruits","OriginalFilename":"1697672259984","Date":"2/13/2020 3:31:44 PM","Type":"cbs","Height":"0","Width":"0","FileSystem":"media","Path":"college-football-recruiting","User":null,"Text":"We'd love to see these guys in a Slam Dunk Contest.","Class":"Video","Thumbnail":"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/api/content/image/0e200f59-b9e3-4f38-92c7-c45e8cec31a5/resize/320x180.jpg","Duration":"62","AssetSource":null,"AssetExtension":null,"Host":"https://s3media.247sports.com","SystemPath":"C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\247sports","DefaultName":"Highlights: Biggest and best dunks from football recruits","Tags":[{"id":"in_24008","name":"Clemson Tigers","type":"College"},{"id":"in_24010","name":"Florida State Seminoles","type":"College"},{"id":"in_24083","name":"TCU Horned Frogs","type":"College"},{"id":"in_24029","name":"Texas A&M Aggies","type":"College"},{"id":"in_24107","name":"Vanderbilt Commodores","type":"College"}],"Location":"Headline Content"});</script>  </section>  </section><footer class="article-cnt__footer"> <a href="https://247sports.com#" class="article-cnt__footer__comments" data-js="comments-show">  Comments (3)  </a> </footer><a href="https://247sports.com" class="seperator-link tfs" %>">247Sports</a><!-- analytics/_simplecomponent.ascx --><!-- Ad Block Checker --><!-- Can only run in the us --><!-- Calling Score Strip --><!-- Third Party Scripts loaded by CMP -->
