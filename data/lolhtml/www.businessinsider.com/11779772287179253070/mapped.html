<p>It turns out all it takes to fool a Tesla&apos;s camera system is a little tape.</p><p>Two security researchers managed to trick two Teslas into accelerating well past the speed limit by fooling their camera systems into misreading a speed sign. We first saw the news <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615244/hackers-can-trick-a-tesla-into-accelerating-by-50-miles-per-hour/">via MIT Technology Review</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/model-hacking-adas-to-pave-safer-roads-for-autonomous-vehicles/">The McAfee researchers Steve Povolny and Shivangee Trivedi</a> stuck 2 inches of black tape on a 35-mph speed sign, slightly elongating the middle line in the &quot;3.&quot;</p><p>They then drove a 2016 Tesla Model X toward the sign with cruise control enabled.</p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-model-3-autopilot-review-compared-to-nissan-propilot-assist-2019-10?r=US&amp;IR=T#adaptive-cruise-control-which-controls-the-cars-speed-and-keeps-it-at-a-set-distance-behind-the-vehicle-in-front-of-it-was-more-useful-but-also-gave-me-more-problems-9">Cruise control</a> is a feature of Tesla&apos;s self-driving system, Autopilot, that is supposed to control the car&apos;s speed and keep it a safe distance behind the car in front of it.</p>



<p>As the car approached the altered sign it misread it as 85 mph &#x2014; and started to accelerate by 50 mph.</p><p>The same happened in a 2016 Model S.</p><div class="iframe-container"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TMr9J5xJruA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>McAfee disclosed the research to Tesla and MobilEye EyeQ3, the company that provides the Tesla 2016 models with their camera systems, last year.

</figure></p><p>Tesla&apos;s newer models use proprietary cameras, and MobilEye EyeQ3 has released newer versions of its cameras that McAfee tested and said were not fooled by the modified sign.</p>



<p>The McAfee researcher Povolny told MIT Tech Review that the findings were still concerning, though, as plenty of 2016 Teslas are still on the roads. &quot;We are not trying to spread fear and say that if you drive this car, it will accelerate into through a barrier, or to sensationalize it,&quot; he said. &quot;The reason we are doing this research is we&apos;re really trying to raise awareness for both consumers and vendors of the types of flaws that are possible.&quot;</p><p>The safety of Tesla&apos;s autopilot systems is under close scrutiny. Last year the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&#xA0;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/federal-government-probes-two-fatal-tesla-crashes-in-florida-2019-3?r=US&amp;IR=T">launched a federal investigation</a> into two fatal Tesla crashes in which it determined the autopilot had been on.</p><p>The company is also fighting a lawsuit against the wife of Walter Huang, an Apple engineer who <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-engineer-walter-huang-family-suing-tesla-over-crash-2019-5?r=US&amp;IR=T">died when his Tesla crashed into a motorway barrier while on Autopilot</a>.</p><p><figure class="figure image-figure-image " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image">

</figure></p><p>According to Huang&apos;s wife, he had complained about the car&apos;s Autopilot veering toward that same barrier multiple times before. Data released by the National Transportation Safety Board last week confirmed the claims, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/02/data-shows-tesla-owner-experienced-same-glitch-days-before-deadly-2018-crash/">per Ars Technica</a>.</p><p>Currently, Tesla emphasizes that its Autopilot tools are not meant to make the car fully autonomous and that drivers must always keep their hands on the wheel. But CEO Elon Musk insists that he intends to make Teslas fully self-driving in the near future.</p>



<p>Last year the tech billionaire <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-doubles-down-on-claim-about-self-driving-tech-2019-2?r=US&amp;IR=T">claimed the company would have a &quot;feature-complete full self-driving&quot;</a> vehicle by the end of 2019. He was <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-contradicts-2019-prediction-about-tesla-autopilot-2020-1?r=US&amp;IR=T">forced to walk back that prediction</a> during Tesla&apos;s Q4 earnings call at the beginning of 2020 but still suggested full self-driving was just on the horizon. &quot;It&apos;s looking like we might be feature-complete in a few months,&quot; Musk said.</p>
