<p>Chinese law professor <a href="http://chinaheritage.net/xu-zhangrun-&#x8A31;&#x7AE0;&#x6F64;/">Xu Zhangrun</a> recently posted a scathing review of the way president Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party have handled the coronavirus outbreak.</p><p>&quot;They all blithely stood by as the crucial window of opportunity to deal with the outbreak of the infection snapped shut in their faces,&quot; he wrote, suggesting that government censorship of information about the coronavirus hampered China&apos;s ability to control its spread.</p><p><a href="http://chinaheritage.net/xu-zhangrun-&#x8A31;&#x7AE0;&#x6F64;/">Xu</a>, who teaches at Beijing&apos;s Tsinghua University, added: &quot;The cause of all of this lies with The Axlerod [that is, Xi Jinping] and the cabal that surrounds him.&quot;</p><p><a href="http://www.chinafile.com/reporting-opinion/viewpoint/viral-alarm-when-fury-overcomes-fear">The essay</a>, published online February 10, was immediately taken down. Xu was placed under house arrest, cut off from the internet, and scrubbed from all social media sites, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/15/xi-critic-professor-this-may-be-last-piece-i-write-words-ring-true">The Guardian reported</a>.</p><p>His critique came three days after Wuhan doctor <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-whistleblower-doctor-li-wenliang-in-critical-condition-2020-2">Li Wenliang died</a> of the coronavirus. Li had sent a message to a group of medical school alumni, warning them about a mysterious new illness. But local police reprimanded and silenced him.</p>



<p>In addition to Li and Xu, at least three citizen journalists have disappeared or were arrested after sharing information about the outbreak on social media.</p><p>Here&apos;s what we know about all five of them.<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wuhan-coronavirus-mild-pandemic-how-it-could-end-2020-2"></a><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/china-wuhan-coronavirus-compared-to-sars-2020-1"></a></p>
