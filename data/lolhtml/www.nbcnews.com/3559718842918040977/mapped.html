And as such, these types of white-collar crimes can be ignored. As a former federal prosecutor, I could not disagree more. In fact, I believe fraud and corruption are among the most serious of crimes, because they are motivated by greed and erode our faith in government.</p><div id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"></div><p class="endmarkEnabled">White-collar crimes are, by definition, usually committed by offenders in positions to succeed financially. They simply want more. Take Blagojevich, for example. Having ascended to governor, he controlled the levers of power in Illinois. Not satisfied with his existing authority, he sought to harness his power to extract even more power and money from others.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">Among other things, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/09/us/politics/10Illinois.html" target="_blank">Blagojevich tried to sell the Senate seat</a> vacated when Barack Obama became president. When public officials abuse power in this way, it deprives the public of the honest services they deserve, damages trust in the government, deters people with integrity from seeking public office themselves and discourages honest business transactions with public officials. People become cynical and disengaged in democracy, which leaves governing to the autocrats. In this way, fraud and corruption have a corrosive effect on society.</p><section class="embedWidget medium___Qn3DV"><div class="usePresentation___EGHVR"><div class="opinary-widget-embed" data-poll="are-you-concerned-by-trumps-presidential-HU8tjH" data-customer="think"></div></div></section><p class="endmarkEnabled">No doubt, taking away someone's liberty is a harsh penalty in a society that treasures freedom. For this reason, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/roger-stone-case-reveals-barr-trump-s-gross-politicization-american-ncna1135936" target="_blank">judges are required to fashion sentences that are sufficient</a> but no greater than necessary. Among the reasons judges impose prison sentences are deterrence and respect for the rule of law. To induce people to comply with the law, they need to know that violations bring consequences.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">Think about the way many drivers behave in traffic. Some people will comply with the speed limit at all times because they respect the rules of the road and the safety goals they seek to promote. Others will exceed the speed limit on the freeway until they see a police car on the side of the road, and then they will suddenly hit their brakes. They slow down not because they respect the rules, but because they don't want to get caught.</p><section class="related related--single dn-print" data-test="related"><h4 class="related__title">Related</h4><div id="related" class="related__items"><div class="relatedItem relatedItem___bedt5 single___eMUer"><div class="relatedItem__thumb thumbnailWrapper___1M3cr"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/we-want-hear-what-you-think-please-submit-letter-editor-ncna1030501?icid=related" class="link___3qfFk pictureLink___3TXZA vilynx_disabled"><div class="lazyload-placeholder"></div></a><span class="eyebrow___1iBD9 think"><a class="label___3cWwg" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/opinion"><span>Opinion</span></a><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/we-want-hear-what-you-think-please-submit-letter-editor-ncna1030501?icid=related" class="vilynx_disabled"></a></span></div><div class="relatedItem__title infoWrapper___1l_Lr"><h3 class="title___142QR"><a class="think" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/opinion"><span class="eyebrow___1iBD9">Opinion</span></a><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/we-want-hear-what-you-think-please-submit-letter-editor-ncna1030501?icid=related" class="link___3qfFk vilynx_disabled">We want to hear what you THINK.

Most use their political and financial power in accordance with the law simply because it is the right thing to do. But we know that without a figurative police officer on the side of the road, some will abuse their power. Criminal punishment is necessary to deter this kind of conduct and promote respect for the rule of law.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">But what if those deterrence measures are provided only sparingly? And what if the more well connected you were, the more likely you would be to get away with breaking the law? Suddenly, we have a very clear set of incentives to ignore the rule of law.</p><div class="container___1unUn mv8 liftOut smallContainer___VvWON mt2-m"><p class="text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond">Predators of all types — from criminals who engage in fraud to those who commit sexual exploitation — often groom their victims for action they want to take in the future.</p></div><p class="endmarkEnabled">Predators of all types — from criminals who engage in fraud to those who commit sexual exploitation — often groom their victims for action they want to take in the future. They use an incremental approach to normalize inappropriate behavior. When the conduct advances only bit by bit, no individual step causes the victim to stop it. At some point, the transformation becomes complete, the behavior has lost its taboo, and the defendant can engage in once-unthinkable misconduct unchecked.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">Trump may be using his pardon power in the same way. By inuring the public to the harm of fraud and corruption, the president can convince his base of supporters that these are not serious crimes.<a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/chicago-politics/a-look-at-all-the-times-trump-came-close-to-commuting-blagojevichs-sentence/2221321/" target="_blank"> He has called the 14-year sentence for Blagojevich</a> "ridiculous," stating that his conviction is based on "a phone call where nothing happened." Sound familiar?</p><section class="embedWidget undefined medium___Qn3DV"><div class="usePresentation___EGHVR"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Rod Blagojevich did not sell the Senate seat.

Blagojevich saw the appointment not as a duty of office but as a moneymaking opportunity. And contrary to Trump's representation that Blagojevich's conviction was based on a single phone call, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/08/us/blagojevich-expresses-remorse-in-courtroom-speech.html" target="_blank">he was convicted on 18 counts</a>, including offenses based on his efforts to pressure a children's hospital and developers of a racetrack to make campaign contributions. As the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/08/us/blagojevich-expresses-remorse-in-courtroom-speech.html" target="_blank">sentencing judge explained</a>, "The harm is the erosion of public trust in government."</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">The timing and the number of the pardons granted Tuesday suggest that something bigger than just these 11 defendants is afoot. Trump's longtime adviser Roger Stone is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-stone/long-time-trump-adviser-stone-to-be-sentenced-by-judge-he-antagonized-idUSKBN20D2KU" target="_blank">scheduled to be sentenced Thursday</a>. Stone will likely be directed to report to a prison to begin serving a sentence in about three months. And so, it may be that Trump is laying the groundwork to pardon Stone, as well.</p><section class="inlineVideo___3ZAlE contentBody___2o_BP mv8"><div class="background___MJluj"><div class="player___16ja0"><div class="videoPlayer videoPlayer___OwcrY adNotPlaying___2SAW9" data-test="video-player"><div class="videoSlate___2dw8N relative"><a href="https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/joe-trump-numbing-everyone-to-future-pardons-78999109891" class="vilynx_disabled allowClicksOnPreview"><div class="vilynx_enabled" data-vilynx-id="https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/joe-trump-numbing-everyone-to-future-pardons-78999109891" data-vilynx-audiopolicycta="true"><picture class=""><source media="(min-width: 1240px)" srcSet="https://media11.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/202002/n_mj_sevena_200219_1920x1080.focal-860x484.jpg"/><source media="(min-width: 758px)" srcSet="https://media11.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/202002/n_mj_sevena_200219_1920x1080.focal-1000x563.jpg"/><img src="https://media11.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/202002/n_mj_sevena_200219_1920x1080.focal-760x428.jpg"/></picture></div></a><div class="playButtonOuter___1gJ-E absolute absolute-fill w100 dn-print" data-test="video-player__play-button__outer"><div class="absolute absolute-fill w100 df items-end items-center-m justify-start justify-center-m"><div class="play___17flh playButton___2unnJ hasRedirect___1vzGS df items-center justify-center tc lh-none"><span class="playIcon___2e5At flex-1 white icon icon-video"></span></div></div></div></div><div id="78999109891"></div></div></div></div><div class="info___3BGcG pt4 pl4 pr8 pt5-m pl6-m pr9-m"><h2 class="title___1CDQX f5 f7-m lh-title founders-cond ma0 pa0"><a href="https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/joe-trump-numbing-everyone-to-future-pardons-78999109891" class="vilynx_disabled">Joe Scarborough: Trump numbing everyone to future pardons</a></h2><span class="infoText___2xq7T f2 ttu mt3"><span>Feb. 19, 2020</span><span>06:17</span></span><div class="share___20RDh share___1JwIX dn-print" data-test="social-share-inline"><div class="shareExpander___2NOfK shareExpander___3rhK_ hoverEffect___2ABX6"><span class="shareDot___1pyZs shareDot___B7eCO"></span></div><div class="shareList___CJe3K shareList___2nQGQ"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/joe-trump-numbing-everyone-to-future-pardons-78999109891" class="shareLink___I3Bnm" target="_blank" rel="noopen noreferrer"><span class="icon icon-facebook shareIcon___1Agiy shareIcon___26LhB"></span></a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Joe Scarborough: Trump numbing everyone to future pardons&amp;via=NBCNewsTHINK&amp;url=https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/joe-trump-numbing-everyone-to-future-pardons-78999109891&amp;original_referer=https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/joe-trump-numbing-everyone-to-future-pardons-78999109891" class="shareLink___I3Bnm" target="_blank" rel="noopen noreferrer"><span class="icon icon-twitter shareIcon___1Agiy shareIcon___26LhB"></span></a><a href="https://www.nbcnews.commailto:?subject=Joe Scarborough: Trump numbing everyone to future pardons&amp;body=https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/joe-trump-numbing-everyone-to-future-pardons-78999109891" class="shareLink___I3Bnm" target="_blank" rel="noopen noreferrer"><span class="icon icon-email shareIcon___1Agiy shareIcon___26LhB"></span></a></div></div></div></section><p class="endmarkEnabled">Trump is using pardons to undermine public faith in the government and the criminal justice system.
