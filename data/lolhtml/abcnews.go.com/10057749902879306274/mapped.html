NASCAR driver Ryan Newman is "awake and speaking with family and doctors" following a fiery crash at the end of Monday night's Daytona 500, according to his team.
</p><p>
"Ryan and his family have expressed their appreciation for the concern and heartfelt messages from across the country," officials with Newman's racing team, Roush Fenway Racing, said in a statement Tuesday afternoon.</p><div data-box-type="fitt-adbox-incontentTeads"><div class="Ad incontentTeads incontentTeads--story ad-slot" data-slot-type="incontentTeads" data-collapse-before-load="true" data-slot-kvps="tag=news,objid=69029794,pgn=us,pgtyp=story,lang=en,sp=abcnews,programmatic=true,bundleId=com.abcnews,level=undefined,pos=incontentTeads"></div></div><div><aside class="InlineElement InlineElement--full-width InlineSocial InlineSocial--desktop"><section class="ContentList"><section class="ContentList__Item"></section></section></aside></div><p>
Roush Fenway officials said earlier that Newman was "in serious condition, but doctors have indicated his injuries are not life threatening."
</p><p>
Newman was leading the race into the final lap when he skidded out while trying to avoid his pursuers. His car slammed into a wall and flipped over, then was struck by at least one car from behind, causing the vehicle to fly through the air.</p><div></div><p>
Corey LaJoie was driving the car that unavoidably slammed into the back of Newman's. LaJoie recalled the "scary crash" in a brief interview Tuesday with ABC News on "Good Morning America."
</p><p>
"It was wild," he said.

After landing on the ground, Newman's car slid on its roof as sparks flew. Then the vehicle briefly burst into flames as it came to rest upside-down on its roof.

Newman was inside the car as crews raced to extinguish the flames and free him from the vehicle.

Denny Hamlin won the race for the second year in a row. Hamlin began celebrating his win after crossing the finish line, but became more somber when he saw the crash.
</p><p>
"It's a weird balance of excitement and happiness for yourself -- but obviously, someone's health and their family is bigger than any win, in any sport. So we're just hoping for the best," Hamlin told ESPN in an interview after the race.</p><div><aside class="InlineElement InlineElement--full-width InlineImage"><figure class="Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image"><div class="Image__Wrapper aspect-ratio--auto"><img class="" alt="" title="" data-mptype="image" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"/></div><figcaption><div class="InlineImage--caption"><div class="InlineImage--source-meta"><img class="Image Logo Logo__xs" alt="Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images" title="Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images" data-mptype="image" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"/></div><span class="InlineImage--caption-meta" aria-hidden="true"><div style="overflow:hidden"><span>Safety crews respond to a wreck involving Ryan Newman, driver of the #6 Koch Industries Ford, after the NASCAR Cup Series 62nd Annual Daytona 500 at Daytona International Speedway, Feb. 17, 2020, in Daytona Beach, Florida.</span></div></span><span class="InlineImage--source-title">Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images</span></div></figcaption></figure></aside></div><p>
NASCAR drivers and racing fans sent words of support for Newman and his family. Jeffrey Earnhardt, who lost his grandfather Dale Earnhardt in a crash during the 2001 Daytona 500, <a href="https://twitter.com/JEarnhardt1/status/1229573268870443010" target="_blank">tweeted</a> that he was praying that Newman was OK.
</p><p>
"Never good to see a wreck like that," he said.
</p><p>
The race began Sunday but was postponed midway through because of rain.
