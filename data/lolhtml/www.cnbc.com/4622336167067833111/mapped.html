Rosie Wild, an officer in the British Army, has become the first woman to pass the All Arms Pre Parachute Selection course, a brutal entry fitness test.</p><p>Women have been able to undertake the &quot;P-company&quot; course since the mid-1990s and Brig. John Clark said several had attempted this feat but Wild was the first to pass.</p><div class="lazyload-placeholder"></div><p>According to airborne forces archive site <a href="https://www.paradata.org.uk/article/p-company-test-week" target="_blank">ParaData</a>, the entry test into the Parachute Regiment is made up of the following eight challenges:</p><ul><li>Marching 10 miles within 1 hour and 50 minutes while carrying a 16kg backpack.</li><li>Completing the &quot;Trainasium&quot; which is an aerial assault course meant to test a soldier&#x27;s ability to overcome fear.</li><li>A log race, where a team of eight carry a 60kg pole over nearly two miles.</li><li>Completing a two-mile steeplechase, which includes a cross-country run and an assault course, within 19 minutes.</li><li>Running two miles with a 16kg backpack and rifle, within 18 minutes.</li><li>An endurance march of 20 miles with a 16kg backpack and rifle, within four and a half hours.</li><li>Teams of 16 soldiers carry a 79kg stretcher over five miles but no more than four people can carry the stretcher at once.</li><li>&quot;Milling&quot; which is similar to boxing where soldiers partake in one minute of &quot;controlled physical aggression&quot; against an opponent. Points are deducted for blocking or dodging punches.</li></ul><p>Clark, commander of the 16 Air Assault Brigade, called Wild a &quot;trailblazer&quot; and hoped that her achievement would encourage more women to try the P-company test.</p><p>&quot;A more representative force will only make us stronger,&quot; he added.</p><p>Wild is set to join the 7 Regiment Royal Horse Artillery, which provides offensive fire support to the 16 Air Assault Brigade. She will be in a parachute role, serving alongside the Parachute Regiment and supporting the British Army&#x27;s Air Assault Task Force, but Wild will not be a Parachute Regiment soldier.</p><p>Chris Collier, a former British Army captain involved in selection, also offered his congratulations to Wild over Twitter.</p><div class="lazyload-placeholder"></div><p>Collier said that he had awarded 1,266 maroon berets — awarded after passing the P-company course — during his time in the Army, all to men, but said this was &quot;not because women couldn&#x27;t pass, but because they simply didn&#x27;t give it a go.&quot;</p><p><div class="lazyload-placeholder"></div></p></div><div id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"></div></div><script>
