            <p>A Labor Day weekend getaway doesn't have to include airfare and costly accommodations. We brainstormed <a href="https://www.chron.com/life/travel/article/100-things-to-do-within-100-miles-of-Houston-2101316.php">short trips</a> and did the math to see where a family of four (two adults and two children ages 9-10) can go and what they can do around Texas for under $500, not including meals.</p>

    
            <p><em>Read about some of the stops below and get more details on the locations you can visit in the gallery above.&nbsp;</em></p>
